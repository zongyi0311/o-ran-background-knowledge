# 5 Physical downlink shared channel related procedures 
## 5.1 UE procedure for receiving the physical downlink shared channel

- HARQ Processes:
  - UE may support up to:
    - 16 HARQ processes per cell
    - 32 HARQ processes per cell
   
- Number of HARQ processes is configured via:
  - nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH
  (If not configured, default is 8)

- HARQ Process ID Assignment:
  - Upon receiving a DCI format (1_0, 1_1, 4_0, etc.), the UE:
    - Decodes the PDSCHs indicated by that DCI.
    - For multiple PDSCHs scheduled in 1 DCI:
      - The first PDSCH is assigned a HARQ process ID.
      - Following PDSCHs get incremented IDs, with modulo based on nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH.
     
- HARQ Process ID Increment Control:
- If overlapping with uplink symbol (UL symbol) in:
  - tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or
  - tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated
 
  ‚Üí Do not increment HARQ process ID for such PDSCHs.

- HARQ Feedback Timing / Restrictions:
  - UE shall not receive new PDSCH for a HARQ process:
    - Until HARQ-ACK has been sent
    - If HARQ feedback is disabled, UE won‚Äôt expect any retransmission.
   
  - For SPS (semi-persistent scheduling), if:
    - HARQ-feedbackEnablingforSPSactive = false ‚Üí UE skips HARQ feedback and won't receive further PDSCHs for the same process.

- Special Handling for Multiple ControlResourceSets:
  - If:
    - UE configured with PDCCH-Config having different coresetPoolIndex
    - Two PDSCHs associated with different CORESETs
  - Then:
    - UE shall not decode 2nd PDSCH if it overlaps in time with the first.
   
- HARQ-ACK Association and Priority Handling for Two PDSCHs
  - When two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of the same priority, the UE shall handle their reception based on the HARQ-ACK priority.
  - If the UE is configured via the higher-layer parameter PDCCH-Config with two different coresetPoolIndex values in ControlResourceSet, and the two PDSCHs are scheduled via PDCCHs from different coresetPoolIndex values:
    - In a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive the second PDSCH if it overlaps in time with the first PDSCH, unless the two HARQ-ACKs are of different priorities.

- PDSCH Scheduling Rules for Multiple HARQ Process IDs
- For any two HARQ process IDs in a scheduled cell:
  - If the first PDSCH starts in symbol j via a PDCCH ending in symbol i,
  - Then the UE shall not receive a second PDSCH that starts earlier than symbol i via a PDCCH that ends later than the one for the first PDSCH.
- If the UE receives two PDCCH candidates from different search space sets 
  - The PDCCH that ends in symbol i is considered the one for the first PDSCH;
  - The UE is not expected to decode retransmissions of an earlier PDSCH if the second PDSCH starts less than N symbols after the first one ends.

- Minimum Symbol Gap ùëÅ for SI-RNTI-based PDSCH Retransmissions

| Subcarrier Spacing (Œº) | Minimum symbol gap (N) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Œº = 0                  | 13                     |
| Œº = 1                  | 13                     |
| Œº = 2                  | 20                     |
| Œº = 3                  | 24                     |
| Œº = 5                  | 96                     |
| Œº = 6                  | 192                    |
