# 4 Frame structure and physical resources 

## 4.1 General 
**Time Domain Unit Definitions**
- Base time unit ùëáùëê is derived from the maximum subcarrier spacing and FFT size:

<img width="582" height="213" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38225ce7-6d68-4e10-925b-e43e0612bcc3" />

- Reference time unit ùëáùë† is used for timing calculations based on a reference subcarrier spacing:

<img width="601" height="369" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77a29fc1-e885-4aca-b416-43dbc4bd9c64" />

## 4.2 Numerologies

Multiple OFDM numerologies are supported as defined in **Table 4.2-1**, where:
- `Œº` is the numerology index
- Subcarrier spacing `Œîf` = 2^Œº √ó 15 kHz
- The cyclic prefix (CP) is determined by higher-layer parameter `cyclicPrefix`.

These values apply to both uplink and downlink bandwidth parts, configured via `subcarrierSpacing` and `cyclicPrefix`.

##  Table 4.2-1: Supported Transmission Numerologies

| Œº | Œîf = 2^Œº¬∑15[kHz] | Cyclic Prefix        |
|---|------------------|----------------------|
| 0 | 15 kHz           | Normal               |
| 1 | 30 kHz           | Normal               |
| 2 | 60 kHz           | Normal, Extended     |
| 3 | 120 kHz          | Normal               |
| 4 | 240 kHz          | Normal               |
| 5 | 480 kHz          | Normal               |
| 6 | 960 kHz          | Normal               |

>  Extended CP is only available for Œº = 2.

---

### Notes

- Larger `Œº` ‚Üí Larger subcarrier spacing ‚Üí Lower symbol duration ‚Üí Suitable for low-latency or high-frequency bands (e.g., mmWave).
- `Œº = 0` and `Œº = 1` are typically used for FR1 (Sub-6GHz).
- `Œº ‚â• 2` are used for FR2 and specific services like URLLC.


## 4.3 Frame structure
**Frames and subframes**
- Downlink, uplink, and sidelink transmissions are organized into radio frames.
- Each radio frame has a duration of 10 ms, denoted as:
- <img width="336" height="77" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e69c772-dc92-40b6-b5bf-f2a4b04d1994" />

- Each frame consists of 10 subframes, and each subframe has:
- <img width="336" height="77" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c984f9d1-4fb6-4845-9201-2d8ccaa0255c" />

- The number of consecutive OFDM symbols per subframe depends on:
- <img width="314" height="49" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3c14cf9-395e-499e-80ec-37a89d59f5dc" />

- Each frame is divided into two half-frames:
  - Half-frame 0: Subframes 0‚Äì4
  - Half-frame 1: Subframes 5‚Äì9
There is one set of frames for uplink and one for downlink on a carrier.

**Uplink Frame Timing (with respect to DL)**
- Uplink frame ùëñ begins at time:
- <img width="700" height="379" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a90a267-692d-4e45-a49f-44acd5192627" />

- <img width="397" height="165" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c57b1c6f-c2e1-4d34-b85a-6c57f069d223" />

- This figure shows that uplink frame ùëñ starts slightly after the start of downlink frame ùëñ by an amount 
ùëáta


**Slots**
## Slot Indexing

For subcarrier spacing configuration `Œº`, slots are numbered as:

- Within a subframe:

 <img width="178" height="33" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64d6194d-a059-4fd4-8d4e-51428d67271a" />

- Within a frame:

<img width="161" height="32" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6368d30-f281-4973-bef6-cd59424f4a1a" />


Each slot consists of `N_symb^slot` OFDM symbols, where the number of symbols depends on the **cyclic prefix** (see Tables 4.3.2-1 and 4.3.2-2).

Slot start is aligned with the **first OFDM symbol** of a subframe.

---

## Slot Type

Each slot may contain symbols classified as:
- **Downlink**
- **Uplink**
- **Flexible**

> The structure of slot formats is defined in TS 38.213, clause 11.1.

- In a **downlink frame**, UE must only transmit in `downlink` or `flexible` symbols.
- In an **uplink frame**, UE must only transmit in `uplink` or `flexible` symbols.

---

## Half/Full Duplex and Transition Constraints

UEs **not supporting full-duplex or simultaneous Tx/Rx** across cells must respect **guard times** between:
- Last DL symbol and next UL slot ‚Üí wait `N_RX‚ÜíTX √ó Tc`
- Last UL symbol and next DL slot ‚Üí wait `N_TX‚ÜíRX √ó Tc`

These timing gaps apply:
- Within a cell
- Across cells in inter-band CA, ENDC, or DAPS handover

See Table 4.3.2-3 for values.

## 4.4 Physical reso

**Antenna Ports**

An **antenna port** is defined such that the channel over which a symbol is transmitted on the port can be inferred from another symbol on the same port.

In other words:  
> If the channel characteristics remain the same for all symbols sent through the same antenna port, they are said to share the same antenna port.

---

**Quasi Co-Located (QCL) Antenna Ports**

Two antenna ports are said to be **quasi co-located** (QCL) if the large-scale channel properties from one port can be inferred from the other.

Large-scale properties include:
- Delay spread
- Doppler spread
- Doppler shift
- Average gain
- Average delay
- Spatial Rx parameters

>  QCL is essential in beamforming and channel estimation. When ports are QCL, UE can reduce overhead in measurements.

---

**4.4.2 Resource Grid**

For each numerology and carrier, a resource grid is defined by:

- `N_grid_k^size,Œº`: Number of subcarriers
- `N_sc^RB`: Number of subcarriers per Resource Block (RB)
- `N_symb^subframe,Œº`: Number of OFDM symbols per subframe

The grid starts from a common resource block index `N_grid^start,Œº`, as configured by higher-layer signaling.

There is **one resource grid per transmission direction**:
- DL: Downlink
- UL: Uplink
- SL: Sidelink

There is **one resource grid per antenna port**, per numerology Œº and per direction.

---

**Carrier Bandwidth and Starting Position**

- Carrier bandwidth `N_grid^size,Œº` for each Œº is set by `carrierBandwidth` in the `SCS-SpecificCarrier` IE.
- Grid starting index `N_grid^start,Œº` is set by `offsetToCarrier` in `SCS-SpecificCarrier`.

---

**Frequency Location**

Each subcarrier‚Äôs frequency location refers to the **center frequency** of the subcarrier.

---

**DC Subcarrier**

- **Downlink**: `txDirectCurrentLocation` (in `SCS-SpecificCarrier`) defines the DC subcarrier index.
  - Values:  
    - 0‚Äì3299: subcarrier index  
    - 3300: DC subcarrier is **outside** the grid

- **Uplink**: `txDirectCurrentLocation` (in `UplinkTxDirectCurrentBWP`) defines the DC subcarrier index.
  - DC is offset by 7.5 kHz from center  
  - Values:  
    - 0‚Äì3299: index  
    - 3300: outside grid  
    - 3301: undetermined

**4.4.3 Resource Elements**

Each element in the resource grid for antenna port *p* and subcarrier spacing configuration *Œº* is called a **resource element**.

It is uniquely identified by:

- $(k, l)_{p,Œº}$
  - *k*: index in the frequency domain
  - *l*: symbol position in the time domain (relative to a reference point)

The resource element $(k, l)_{p,Œº}$ corresponds to:
- A **physical resource**
- The **complex value** $a_{k,l}^{(p,Œº)}$

When there is no ambiguity, the indices *p* and *Œº* may be dropped:
- $a_{k,l}^{(p)}$
- or simply $a_{k,l}$

**4.4.4 Resource Blocks**

**4.4.4.1 General**
A Resource Block (RB) is defined as:
- `N_sc^RB = 12` consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain.

---

**4.4.4.2 Point A**

Point A serves as a **common reference point** for RB grids, and is obtained from:

- `offsetToPointA`:
  - Represents the frequency offset from point A to the lowest subcarrier of the lowest resource block.
  - Expressed in units of RBs (15 kHz spacing for FR1, 60 kHz spacing for FR2 and FR2-NTN).
  - Used for initial cell selection via SS/PBCH.

- For operation **without shared spectrum channel access**:
  - In FR1, FR2-1, and FR2-NTN: the lowest RB uses the spacing from `subCarrierSpacingCommon`.

- For operation **with shared spectrum access**:
  - In FR1 or FR2, or FR2 without shared access: lowest RB aligns with SS/PBCH block used in cell selection.

- `absoluteFrequencyPointA`: used when expressed as ARFCN (absolute RF channel number).

---

**4.4.4.3 Common Resource Blocks**

- Common RBs are numbered from `0` upwards in frequency for subcarrier spacing `Œº`.
- The **center of subcarrier 0** of **common RB 0** for numerology `Œº` is aligned with **Point A**.

- The formula for RB index:
  
$$
n_{\text{CRB}}^{\mu} = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}} \right\rfloor
$$

Where:
- *k* is the subcarrier index **relative to Point A**, with `k = 0` at the subcarrier centered at Point A.

**4.4.4.4 Physical Resource Blocks**

- Physical RBs are defined per subcarrier spacing Œº and within each bandwidth part (BWP).
- Indexed from 0 to $N_{BWP,i}^{size,Œº}$ - 1, where *i* is the BWP index.
- The mapping to common resource block (CRB) is:

$$
n_{\text{CRB}}^{\mu} = n_{\text{PRB}}^{\mu} + N_{\text{BWP},i}^{\text{start},\mu}
$$


- $N_{BWP,i}^{start,Œº}$: The CRB index where the BWP *i* starts.
- When Œº is clear from context, it may be omitted.

---

**4.4.4.5 Virtual Resource Blocks**

- VRBs are also defined within each BWP.
- Indexed from 0 to `N_BWP,i^size - 1`.

---

**4.4.4.6 Interlaced Resource Blocks**

- Multiple interlaces *m* ‚àà {0, 1, ..., M-1} are supported.
- Each interlace contains CRBs at offsets like `{m, M + m, 2M + m, ...}`.
- M depends on numerology Œº and is given by:

| Œº | M  |
|---|----|
| 0 | 10 |
| 1 | 5  |

- Mapping from interlace RBs to CRBs:

$$
n_{\text{CRB}}^{\mu} = M \cdot n_{\text{IRB},m}^{\mu} + N_{\text{BWP},i}^{\text{start},\mu} + \left( (m - N_{\text{BWP},i}^{\text{start},\mu}) \bmod M \right)
$$

- `n_IRB,m^Œº`: Interlace RB index *n* in interlace *m*.
- The UE expects at least 10 CRBs in any interlace within a BWP.
