# 2.1 Clients and Servers

**What is a Server?**
- A **server** is a host with specific software installed that allows it to provide services—such as email or web pages—to other devices on a network.
- Every website or service you access online is delivered by a server somewhere on a network connected to the global internet.

**What is a Client?**
- A **client** is a host with software that enables it to request and display information from servers.
- Client software examples include:
  - Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or Chrome.
 
**Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks**

- Typically, client and server software run on separate machines.
- a single computer can run both client and server software simultaneously,
- This setup is known as a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network**.

---
**Basic P2P Setup**
- The **simplest P2P network** involves two computers connected directly via wired or wireless connection.
- Each computer can share data or services, functioning as either a client or server as needed.
---

**Advantages of P2P Networks**
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Lower cost (no need for dedicated servers or expensive devices)

**Disadvantages of P2P Networks**
- No centralized administration
- Less secure
- Not scalable
- Performance issues
-

# 2.2 Network Components

**End Devices**

- **End devices**, also known as **hosts**, are the interface between users and the communication network.
- These devices are the most familiar network components to users.
- An end device is either the **source** or **destination** of data transmitted across a network.

---

**Communication Role and Addressing**
- Every host is assigned a **unique address** for identification.
- When a host initiates communication, it uses the **destination host's address** to deliver the message.
- End devices are responsible for generating and receiving data in the network.

# 2.3 ISP Connectivity Options
## ISP Services
**What Is an ISP?**
- An **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** is the bridge between a home or business network and the global internet.
- Types of ISPs include:
  - Local cable companies
  - Landline telephone providers
  - Cellular network providers

---

**Additional Services Provided by ISPs**
Many ISPs offer extra services to their subscribers, such as:
- Email accounts
- Network/cloud storage
- Web hosting services
- Automated data backup

---

**Role of ISPs in the Global Internet**
- ISPs connect with one another to form a worldwide communication network.
- These connections are **hierarchical**.
- This hierarchy helps that data travels the **shortest and fastest path** 

---

**The Internet Backbone**
- The **internet backbone** is a high-speed, high-capacity infrastructure that connects ISP networks across the globe.
- The main medium used is **fiber-optic cable**:
  - **Underground cables** and **Undersea fiber-optic cables** 

## ISP Connections

**The Internet Backbone**
- The **backbone of the internet** is built from a vast web of **fiber-optic cables**, **high-end switches**, and **routers**.
- These devices **direct data traffic** between the source and destination across global networks.

---

**Connecting a Home Network to the ISP**

- A **direct modem-to-computer connection** is the simplest setup,but **Not recommended**
  - The computer is exposed to the internet without any protection.

- Use a **wireless integrated router** between the modem and devices.
  includes:
  - A **router** to manage and secure traffic
  - A **built-in switch** for wired connections
  - A **wireless access point (AP)** for Wi-Fi devices

---

## Cable and DSL Connections

- Most home networks do not use fiber-optic cables to connect directly to their ISP.
- The two most common alternatives are **Cable** and **DSL**.

---

**Cable**

- Typically provided by **cable TV service providers**.
- Uses the same **coaxial cable** that delivers television signals.
- Offers **high bandwidth** and is **always-on**.
- Requires a **cable modem** to:
  - Separate internet data from TV signals.
  - Provide an **Ethernet connection** to a computer or LAN.

---

**DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**

- Uses standard **telephone lines (twisted-pair)**.
- Also offers **high bandwidth** and is **always-on**.
- Requires a **DSL modem** to:
  - Separate telephone and internet signals.
  - Provide an **Ethernet connection** to a computer or LAN.

- DSL splits the line into **three channels**:
  1. **Voice channel** – allows phone calls without interrupting internet use.
  2. **Download channel** – receives data from the internet (faster).
  3. **Upload channel** – sends data to the internet (slower than download).
