## Computers and Binary Digits â€“ Key Points

### 1. Computers Use Only Binary (0 and 1)
- All data in computers is represented using **binary digits** (bits).
- A **bit** is the smallest unit of data and can be either **0 or 1**.
- The term *bit* stands for **binary digit**.

---

### 2. How a Bit is Physically Represented
A bit is stored/transmitted as one of two possible **discrete states**, such as:
- Two directions of magnetization
- Two voltage or current levels
- Two light intensities
- On/Off switch (e.g., Light switch: **On = 1**, **Off = 0**)

---

### 3. Input Devices Convert Human Actions to Binary
- Input devices like **keyboard**, **mouse**, and **voice sensors** translate actions into **binary code**.
- This binary data is then processed by the **CPU**.

---

### 4. Output Devices Translate Binary to Human-Readable Form
- Output devices such as **monitors**, **speakers**, and **printers** convert binary data back into:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Sound

---

### 5. All Internal Data is Binary
- Inside a computer, **all data is stored and processed as binary**.
- Words, pictures, videos, and sounds are just complex **patterns of bits**.
