## Localization Architecture in 5G NR
- It illustrates control-plane positioning (CP-LCS) in 5G: the main entities, the interfaces between them, and which protocol is used by whom.
- UE ‚Äî User Equipment.
- gNB ‚Äî 5G base station (NG-RAN node).
- AMF ‚Äî Access and Mobility Management Function in the 5G Core. It relays LPP messages to the LMF and provides UE context.
- LMF ‚Äî Location Management Function. The brain of positioning: configures measurements/assistance, collects reports, and computes the position.

- Interfaces / protocols
  - NR-Uu (UE ‚Üî gNB): the radio interface. Carries the actual positioning reference signals and reports, e.g., DL-PRS/CSI-RS/SSB (downlink) and SRS/PRACH (uplink).
  - NG-C (N2) (gNB ‚Üî AMF): control-plane interface that transports RRC/NAS signaling.
  - LPP (UE ‚Üî LMF): LTE/NR Positioning Protocol (extended for NR in Rel-16).
    - Goes via NAS: the UE wraps LPP in NAS to the AMF, which forwards it to the LMF (the slide draws UE‚ÜîLMF, but AMF relays it).
    - Purpose: measurement configuration, assistance data, measurement reports, and results between UE and LMF.
  - NRPPa (gNB ‚Üî LMF): NR Positioning Protocol-A (Rel-15).
    - Purpose: LMF‚ÜîRAN coordination. The LMF requests/provides assistance (e.g., PRS scheduling) and measurement tasks; the gNB returns results (time/angle/power, etc.).
  - Nls / Nlmf_Location (AMF ‚Üî LMF): a 5GC service-based interface used for the AMF to forward LPP and exchange location-related context/events with the LMF.

- Two typical flows
  - Downlink positioning
    - LMF ‚Üí gNB (NRPPa): send assistance/measurement requests (PRS config, timing, etc.).
    - gNB ‚Üí UE (RRC over NR-Uu): deliver PRS/measurement config; the gNB transmits DL-PRS/CSI-RS as scheduled.
    - UE measures (ToA/TDoA, RSRP, AoD‚Ä¶) ‚Üí UE ‚Üí LMF (LPP over NAS via AMF): send measurement report.
    - LMF fuses/estimates the position ‚Üí returns via LPP to the UE or exposes to applications.
  - Uplink positioning
    - LMF ‚Üí gNB (NRPPa): ask one or more gNBs to measure the UE‚Äôs SRS/PRACH (arrival time/angle).
    - UE transmits SRS/PRACH (NR-Uu); gNB measures and reports via NRPPa to the LMF.
    - LMF combines multi-cell measurements to compute the position; if needed, informs the UE via LPP.

- The UE transmits uplink SRS (or PRACH). Multiple synchronized gNBs receive it and estimate the Time of Arrival (ToA).
- Each gNB sends its ToA to the LMF via NRPPa (relayed by the AMF).
- The LMF converts ToAs to TDoAs (pairwise differences), solves for the UE‚Äôs coordinates from the intersection of the resulting hyperbolas, and exposes the position through an LCS API.

- Signaling / interfaces (matching the figure)
  - NR-Uu: UE ‚Üí gNB radio link carrying SRS.
  - NRPPa (NG-C / Nls): gNB reports ToA to LMF (via AMF).
  - LPP (not drawn): used in UE-based flows between UE and LMF; this slide focuses on the network-based case.
  - LCS: external location service interface (HTTP).

- In TDoA = ToA·µ¢ ‚àí ToA‚±º, the UE transmit clock bias cancels, so only inter-gNB synchronization must be tight (GNSS, IEEE-1588/TSN, etc.).
- Geometry: for gNBs ùëñ,ùëó
- <img width="650" height="129" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ec49c2-ce77-4c00-8f41-4c7f3ca6bc2c" />

- More bandwidth ‚áí finer ToA resolution: ideal timing resolution ‚âà 1/BW; ~400 MHz can approach sub-meter (needs high SNR and calibration).
- Inter-gNB synchronization is critical: clock error maps directly to range-difference error.
- Multipath/NLOS: mitigate with peak selection, RANSAC/consistency checks, or add AoA aids.
- Geometry/observability: at least 3 gNBs (‚â•2 TDoAs) for robust intersections; poor geometry inflates error (GDOP).
- Uplink references: typically SRS (wideband, repeatable); PRACH is possible but with bandwidth/interpolation constraints.


- Implementation of 3GPP UL-TDoA Positioning in OAI
- RAN: Performs SRS‚ÜíToA estimation in the OAI gNB; implements NRPPa functionality and sends it to the AMF.
- Core: Integrates with the TU-Dresden LMF; communicates NRPPa PDUs between the gNB and AMF, and between the AMF and LMF; implements built-in/pluggable positioning algorithms in the LMF; and connects to the Fraunhofer IIS PaaS.
- API: Externally triggers positioning; accurately aligns antenna and UE positions using Cartesian coordinates.

## 1.1 Background
- Communications and radar have evolved separately but share algorithms, hardware, and partially architectures.Driven by spectrum/cost/energy sharing, there‚Äôs growing interest in coexistence ‚Üí cooperation ‚Üí joint design (JCAS/ISAC).
- Traditional coexistence: Two independent systems transmit **separate signals** (possibly overlapping in time/frequency) and rely on **interference management** (beamforming, cooperative/dynamic sharing, primary‚Äìsecondary access).**Limits**: requires tight mobility constraints and information exchange; spectral-efficiency gains are limited and conditions are stringent.
- Passive sensing: Use arbitrary radio signals (TV, Wi-Fi, cellular) for sensing because the environment imprints on received signals.

  Pros: no dedicated radar waveform needed.
  
  Two major drawbacks:
  - TX/RX not synchronized ‚Üí unknown, time-varying time/frequency/phase offsets ‚áí timing/ranging ambiguity and hard-to-fuse measurements.
  - Unknown signal structure ‚Üí poor interference suppression and multi-user separation; waveforms are not optimized for sensing.

- From ‚Äúradar‚Äù to broader ‚Äúradio sensing‚Äù:
  - Radio sensing = extracting information from received radio signals (not from the carried comms data).
  - Two processing tracks: sensing parameter estimation (delay, AoA/AoD, Doppler, path magnitudes) and pattern recognition (device/object/activity ‚Äúradio signatures‚Äù).
  - Works over existing infrastructures (IoT, Wi-Fi, 5G). Many studies show low-bandwidth comms signals can support sensing (e.g., Wi-Fi, RFID, ZigBee).
 
- JCAS/ISAC core idea: One jointly designed transmit signal serves both communications and sensing.
  - Hardware sharing: most TX modules and much of RX hardware are shared (baseband processing diverges).
  - Advantages over passive sensing: controllable synchronization, known signal structure, multi-user separation/interference suppression, and waveform/scheduling optimized for sensing.
  - Different from:
    - Separated waveforms (time/frequency/code partition),
    - Conventional coexistence (two independent systems avoiding interference),
    - Cognitive radio (secondary users opportunistically access spectrum).
JCAS = one system, one signal, jointly designed for both functions.

| Coexistence               | Two waveforms (may overlap) | Interference management/sharing       | Reuse spectrum; incremental deployment                  | Needs coordination/sync; limited net gain            |

| Cognitive radio           | Comms-centric               | Sense spectrum ‚Üí opportunistic access | Better spectrum utilization                             | Not designed for sensing tasks                       |

## 1.2 Three Categories of JCAS Systems

| Aspect                  | Communication-centric                      | Radar-centric                                 | Joint design & optimization                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Design priority         | Communications first                       | Radar/sensing first                           | Balanced (tunable)                                    |
| Waveform basis          | Reuse comms (e.g., OFDM)                   | Reuse radar (pulse/chirp/FMCW)                | New or hybrid, co-designed (DFRC/ISAC)                |
| Comms performance       | **High**, standard-friendly                | Constrained throughput/SE                     | Potentially high (by design)                          |
| Sensing performance     | Scenario-dependent, harder to optimize     | **Near-optimal**                              | Potentially high (by design freedom)                  |
| Standards compatibility | Minor extensions                           | Radar-led, loosely tied to comms standards    | May need new specs / larger changes                   |
| HW changes              | Small‚Äìmedium                               | Small (keep radar chain)                      | Medium‚Äìlarge (high sharing/co-design)                 |
| Typical strength        | Fast deployment, easy in existing networks | Excellent radar accuracy/range                | Best spectrum/energy efficiency; system-level optimum |
| Typical weakness        | Limited sensing flexibility/accuracy       | Limited data rate                             | Design complexity; ecosystem/standardization effort   |
| Good fit                | Add sensing inside 3GPP/Wi-Fi systems      | Radar-centric domains (automotive/industrial) | Greenfield/6G R\&D, private networks                  |


### 1.2.1 Major Differences Between Communications and Sensing
- Radar/radio-sensing signals are built to estimate physical parameters (range, Doppler, angle) accurately and simply.
- Communication signals are built to carry as much information as reliably as possible across many users and QoS profiles.
- Because the design goals differ, their preferred waveforms/structures conflict, so you can‚Äôt drop one into the other without tweaks.

| Dimension            | Radar / Sensing                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Communications                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary goal**     | High-accuracy localization & tracking; simple parameter estimation                                                                                                                                               | Maximize information rate & reliability across users/QoS                                                                                             |
| **Waveform traits**  | Low **PAPR** ‚Üí efficient PA & long range; **sharp ambiguity function** (narrow/steep mainlobe, low sidelobes) for high range/Doppler resolution; often deterministic (pulses, chirps, constant-envelope options) | Rich **modulation/coding** across time/frequency/space; **packetized**, scheduler-driven; may be **discontinuous/fragmented** over RBs, slots, beams |
| **Resource use**     | Typically contiguous time‚Äìfrequency blocks, long coherent processing intervals                                                                                                                                   | Highly dynamic allocation (OFDMA/TDMA/beam hopping, CA), multiuser multiplexing                                                                      |
| **Receiver focus**   | Matched filtering, range‚ÄìDoppler‚Äìangle estimation, CFAR                                                                                                                                                          | Sync, channel estimation, equalization, decoding, HARQ                                                                                               |
| **Typical waveform** | Pulsed/linear-FM (chirp), CW/FMCW, radar-OFDM with sensing-friendly design                                                                                                                                       | OFDM/OFDMA with high PAPR and data payloads + pilots/DMRS                                                                                            |

- Using comms for sensing suffers from high PAPR, fragmented resources, and an OFDM ambiguity function that isn‚Äôt ideal (range‚ÄìDoppler coupling, sidelobes) ‚Üí needs dedicated pilots/PRS, windowing, guard resources, or PAPR reduction.
- Using radar for comms preserves sensing accuracy, but limits data rate/spectral efficiency unless you relax radar optimality.
- Joint design can tune: pilot density, burst timing, bandwidth, beam scheduling, and waveform shaping to get both good sensing resolution and acceptable throughput/latency.


- Two conventional radar families:
  - Pulsed radar: transmits short, wideband pulses, then stays silent to receive echoes.
  - Continuous-wave radar (e.g., FMCW): transmits continuously (often chirps), sweeping over a wide frequency range.
  
  Both are typically non-modulated and used in SISO or MIMO (with orthogonal waveforms for MIMO).
  
- Design goals for radar waveforms:
  - Low PAPR ‚Üí efficient power amplifiers and long-range operation.
  - Sharp ambiguity function (narrow/steep mainlobe, low sidelobes) ‚Üí high range/Doppler resolution.
  - Simple receiver processing to estimate delay, Doppler, and angle of arrival.
  
- Sampling/processing differences:
  - Pulsed radar: sample roughly at 2√ó the pulse bandwidth, or at a lower rate set by the desired range (delay) resolution.
  - FMCW radar: sample only the beat frequency, at a rate much smaller than the sweep bandwidth, sized to the maximum delay to detect.

# UE apply: openair2/LAYER2/NR_MAC_UE/config_ue.c
## configure_dedicated_BWP_ul()
- config_ue.c is OAI‚Äôs UE-side RRC‚ÜíMAC/PHY configuration bridge. It parses the gNB‚Äôs RRC messages (MIB, SIB1/SIB19, CellGroupConfig, etc.) and translates their ASN.1 IEs into OAI UE internal state and PHY/FAPI config. It sets up carrier/BWP/CORESET & search spaces, PDSCH/PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS, CSI-RS & CSI reporting, timers (BSR/SR/TA), TDD pattern, PRACH, builds the valid SSB list, applies reconfiguration-with-sync, handles NTN timing advance (Rel-17), and cleans up on reset.
- **Guard & fetch BWP slot**
  - If ul_dedicated is non-NULL, it calls get_ul_bwp_structure(mac, bwp_id, true) to get (or create) the internal NR_UE_UL_BWP_t for bwp_id.
  - Sets bwp->bwp_id = bwp_id.
- **UCCH configuration (uplink control channel)**
  - Checks ul_dedicated->pucch_Config.
  - Release case: if present == ...PR_release, frees the existing bwp->pucch_Config via asn1cFreeStruc(asn_DEF_NR_PUCCH_Config, ...).
  - Setup case: if present == ...PR_setup, ensures bwp->pucch_Config exists (allocates with calloc if needed), then calls
    setup_pucchconfig(ul_dedicated->pucch_Config->choice.setup, bwp->pucch_Config)
    to translate the ASN.1 RRC IE into the UE‚Äôs internal structure.
- **PUSCH configuration (uplink shared channel)**
  - Same pattern:
    - Release: asn1cFreeStruc(asn_DEF_NR_PUSCH_Config, bwp->pusch_Config).
    - Setup: allocate if NULL, then
      setup_puschconfig(mac, ul_dedicated->pusch_Config->choice.setup, bwp->pusch_Config).

- **SRS configuration (sounding reference signal)**
  - Same pattern:
    - Release: asn1cFreeStruc(asn_DEF_NR_SRS_Config, bwp->srs_Config).
    - Setup: allocate if NULL, then
      setup_srsconfig(bwp, ul_dedicated->srs_Config->choice.setup, bwp->srs_Config).

- Typically invoked when the UE processes an RRC(Re)configuration that modifies uplink BWP-dedicated settings. After this call, the UE MAC (and then PHY) will use the updated per-BWP configs for uplink scheduling, control reporting (PUCCH), data (PUSCH), and channel sounding (SRS).

## setup_srsconfig()
- setup_srsconfig(...) merges the source RRC SRS-Config (source) into the UE's current BWP SRS-Config (target). It follows the RRC AddMod/Release rules: if there is an Add/Mod, the corresponding SRS-Resource / SRS-ResourceSet is added or updated; if there is a Release, the corresponding target item is released based on the id; simple fields (such as tpc_Accumulation) are also updated.
- ket steps:
  - UPDATE_IE: If the source provides tpc_Accumulation, copy it to the target.
  - SRS-Resource:
    - AddModList ‚Üí Ensure the target list exists, then add/update it using srs_ResourceId as the key.
    - ReleaseList ‚Üí Remove from the target list based on srs_ResourceId.
  - SRS-ResourceSet:
    - AddModList ‚Üí Compare srs_ResourceSetIds one by one. If they don't exist, calloc + append a new set (ASN_SEQUENCE_ADD); then use setup_srsresourceset(...) to write the source set's fields to the target set.
    - ReleaseList ‚Üí Remove from the target list based on srs_ResourceSetId.
  - bwp passes setup_srsresourceset(...) to facilitate the helper's calculation/validation of derived fields based on the BWP state.
 
## setup_srsresourceset()
- What setup_srsresourceset(...) does (purpose & flow)
- This routine merges one SRS-ResourceSet IE (source) into the UE‚Äôs current UL-BWP SRS-ResourceSet (target) and updates any derived power-control cache in the BWP when key fields change. It handles the resourceType CHOICE (aperiodic/periodic/semi-persistent), membership lists, usage, and SRS power-control knobs (alpha, p0, pathlossReferenceRS, adjustment states).

# TS 138 214  6.2 UE reference signal (RS) procedure 
## 6.2.1 UE sounding procedure 
- SRS configuration scope
  - UE can be configured with one or more SRS-ResourceSets (and, separately, SRS-PosResourceSets for positioning).
  - In each SRS-ResourceSet, the UE may have K ‚â• 1 SRS-Resources:
    - K (normal SRS) is bounded by UE capability (see UE-cap in 38.306).
    - K (PosSRS): max K = 16.
  - Whether a resource/set applies depends on the usage field of the SRS-ResourceSet.
- Simultaneous transmission rule
  - If usage = beamManagement: at any instant, only one SRS resource per set may be transmitted.
  - However, resources from different sets with the same time-domain behavior (periodicity/offset etc.) within the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously.
- TCI linkage (beam state the UE should use)
  - If the UE is configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, then (with two exceptions noted below) SRS resources in any set can be associated with those TCI states or updated per the referenced clause.
  - Reference RS for TCI:
    - DLorJoint-TCIState: reference can be a CSI-RS in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with repetition or with trs-Info (TRS).
    - UL-TCIState: reference can be a CSI-RS (as above), an SRS resource with usage=beamManagement, or an SS/PBCH block (SSB), possibly with a different PCI than the serving cell.
  - Exceptions: the generic assumption above does not apply to
    - positioning SRS resources, and
    - SRS resource sets configured with followUnifiedTCIState-r17 (those follow the unified TCI behavior explicitly).
- Follow-Unified-TCI (r17) for SRS-ResourceSet
   - If an SRS-ResourceSet (not for positioning) is configured with followUnifiedTCIstate-r17, the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) using the spatial relation (beam / spatial filter) of the reference RS tied to the indicated TCI state:
     - The reference RS is either:
     - For DLorJoint-TCIState: a CSI-RS in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet with repetition or with trs-Info (TRS).
     - For UL-TCIState: a CSI-RS as above, or an SRS with usage=beamManagement, or an SS/PBCH block (SSB) ‚Äî possibly with PCI ‚â† serving cell PCI.
  - Effect: the SRS beamforming follows the downlink (or unified) TCI reference, ensuring DL/UL spatial consistency.
- Aperiodic SRS selection (by DCI)
  - For aperiodic SRS, at least one DCI state selects at least one of the configured SRS-ResourceSet(s).
  - Practical: the gNB uses a DCI field (trigger state) to point to which set (and therefore which resources) the UE should transmit in a given slot.

### Semi-static (higher-layer) SRS parameters
- These are the RRC-configured knobs that define how an SRS looks and when/where it is sent. They change rarely (until a new RRC reconfiguration) and drive both scheduler choices and PHY mapping
- These parameters define when (slot/symbol), where (RBs/subcarriers), how wide (bandwidth/hopping), with which beam/ports (spatial relation, ports), and with what orthogonality (comb/shift/sequence) the UE transmits SRS.
- The scheduler uses them to pick resources/sets (and offsets for aperiodic), while PHY uses them to generate the exact SRS waveform and set the TX spatial filter.

- Overlap with PUSCH/PUCCH (priority rules)
  - PUSCH (priority index 0) + SRS (same slot, serving cell): UE may only send SRS after finishing PUSCH and its DM-RS in that slot.
  - PUSCH (priority 1) or PUCCH (priority 1) overlapping with SRS: UE does not transmit SRS in the overlapping symbol(s).       

- Periodic SRS ‚Äî spatial relation (beam to use)
  - When resourceType = periodic and spatialRelationInfo (or ‚Ä¶PDC, ‚Ä¶Pos) is configured, the UE transmits SRS with the same spatial-domain TX filter as the reference RS indicated:
  - Reference = SSB (ssb-Index / ‚Ä¶Serving / ‚Ä¶Ncell): use SSB-based spatial filter.
  - Reference = CSI-RS (csi-RS-Index / ‚Ä¶Serving): use the filter used to receive that periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS.
  - Reference = SRS (srs / srs-spatialRelation): use the filter used to transmit the reference periodic SRS.
  - Positioning SRS (SRS-PosResource + dl-PRS): use the filter used to receive the DL-PRS.
  - spatialRelationInfo-PDC with dl-PRS-PDC: use the filter used for DL-PRS reception for RTT-based delay compensation (per spec Clause 9).
The transmit beam of the periodic SRS is not determined autonomously, but follows the indicated reference RS/SSB/PRS to ensure DL/UL spatial consistency or the consistency required by the positioning algorithm.

- UE has one or more SRS resources and the higher-layer resourceType is semi-persistent (either SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource).
- When the activation actually takes effect
  - The gNB sends a MAC activation command (38.321 ¬ß6.1.3.17 / ¬ß6.1.3.36) on a PDSCH.
  - Suppose the HARQ-ACK for that PDSCH is sent by the UE on PUCCH in slot n.Then the SRS start assumptions (and the MAC actions) become valid from the first slot strictly after:

- The activation command also tells you which beam to use
- It includes a list of reference-signal IDs, one per element of the activated SRS-ResourceSet.
- Each ID defines the spatial relation (i.e., which RX/TX spatial filter/beam to copy) for the corresponding SRS.
  - If the set is SRS-ResourceSet (non-positioning):
    - Each ID may refer to one of:
      - an SS/PBCH block (SSB),
      - an NZP-CSI-RS on the serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID in the command (or the set‚Äôs cell if absent),
      - an SRS resource on the serving cell and UL BWP indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID and Resource BWP ID (or the set‚Äôs cell/BWP if absent).
  - If the set is SRS-PosResourceSet (positioning):
    - Each ID may refer to one of:
      - an SSB on a serving or non-serving cell (given by the PCI field),
      - an NZP-CSI-RS on the serving cell (as above),
      - an SRS resource on the serving cell + UL BWP (as above),
      - a DL-PRS on a serving or non-serving cell (by DL-PRS ID).
     
- In practice: when you activate a semi-persistent SRS set, the command binds each SRS in the set to a specific reference RS/SSB/PRS, and the UE must transmit that SRS using the same spatial-domain filter/beam as that reference.

- Override rule (activation wins)
  - If a resource in the activated set already had an RRC-configured spatialRelationInfo/‚Ä¶Pos, the reference ID(s) carried in the activation command override those.
  ‚Üí During the active period, use the activation‚Äôs reference to choose the SRS TX beam, not the one from RRC.
- Deactivation timing
  - When the UE gets a deactivation command and would send the HARQ-ACK for its PDSCH on PUCCH in slot n, the stop takes effect from the first slot after:

- How to choose the SRS transmit beam (spatial relation)
  - If spatialRelationInfo/‚Ä¶Pos identifies one of the following, transmit the target SRS with the same spatial-domain filter used for that reference:
  - ssb-Index / ‚Ä¶Serving / ‚Ä¶Ncell (SSB): use the SSB receive beam.
  - csi-RS-Index / ‚Ä¶IndexServing (NZP-CSI-RS): use the receive filter for that periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS.
  - srs / srs-SpatialRelation (SRS): use the transmit filter used for that periodic/semi-persistent SRS.
  - dl-PRS (only for SRS-PosResourceSet): use the DL-PRS receive filter.
