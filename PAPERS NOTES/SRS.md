## Localization Architecture in 5G NR
- It illustrates control-plane positioning (CP-LCS) in 5G: the main entities, the interfaces between them, and which protocol is used by whom.
- UE ‚Äî User Equipment.
- gNB ‚Äî 5G base station (NG-RAN node).
- AMF ‚Äî Access and Mobility Management Function in the 5G Core. It relays LPP messages to the LMF and provides UE context.
- LMF ‚Äî Location Management Function. The brain of positioning: configures measurements/assistance, collects reports, and computes the position.

- Interfaces / protocols
  - NR-Uu (UE ‚Üî gNB): the radio interface. Carries the actual positioning reference signals and reports, e.g., DL-PRS/CSI-RS/SSB (downlink) and SRS/PRACH (uplink).
  - NG-C (N2) (gNB ‚Üî AMF): control-plane interface that transports RRC/NAS signaling.
  - LPP (UE ‚Üî LMF): LTE/NR Positioning Protocol (extended for NR in Rel-16).
    - Goes via NAS: the UE wraps LPP in NAS to the AMF, which forwards it to the LMF (the slide draws UE‚ÜîLMF, but AMF relays it).
    - Purpose: measurement configuration, assistance data, measurement reports, and results between UE and LMF.
  - NRPPa (gNB ‚Üî LMF): NR Positioning Protocol-A (Rel-15).
    - Purpose: LMF‚ÜîRAN coordination. The LMF requests/provides assistance (e.g., PRS scheduling) and measurement tasks; the gNB returns results (time/angle/power, etc.).
  - Nls / Nlmf_Location (AMF ‚Üî LMF): a 5GC service-based interface used for the AMF to forward LPP and exchange location-related context/events with the LMF.

- Two typical flows
  - Downlink positioning
    - LMF ‚Üí gNB (NRPPa): send assistance/measurement requests (PRS config, timing, etc.).
    - gNB ‚Üí UE (RRC over NR-Uu): deliver PRS/measurement config; the gNB transmits DL-PRS/CSI-RS as scheduled.
    - UE measures (ToA/TDoA, RSRP, AoD‚Ä¶) ‚Üí UE ‚Üí LMF (LPP over NAS via AMF): send measurement report.
    - LMF fuses/estimates the position ‚Üí returns via LPP to the UE or exposes to applications.
  - Uplink positioning
    - LMF ‚Üí gNB (NRPPa): ask one or more gNBs to measure the UE‚Äôs SRS/PRACH (arrival time/angle).
    - UE transmits SRS/PRACH (NR-Uu); gNB measures and reports via NRPPa to the LMF.
    - LMF combines multi-cell measurements to compute the position; if needed, informs the UE via LPP.

- The UE transmits uplink SRS (or PRACH). Multiple synchronized gNBs receive it and estimate the Time of Arrival (ToA).
- Each gNB sends its ToA to the LMF via NRPPa (relayed by the AMF).
- The LMF converts ToAs to TDoAs (pairwise differences), solves for the UE‚Äôs coordinates from the intersection of the resulting hyperbolas, and exposes the position through an LCS API.

- Signaling / interfaces (matching the figure)
  - NR-Uu: UE ‚Üí gNB radio link carrying SRS.
  - NRPPa (NG-C / Nls): gNB reports ToA to LMF (via AMF).
  - LPP (not drawn): used in UE-based flows between UE and LMF; this slide focuses on the network-based case.
  - LCS: external location service interface (HTTP).

- In TDoA = ToA·µ¢ ‚àí ToA‚±º, the UE transmit clock bias cancels, so only inter-gNB synchronization must be tight (GNSS, IEEE-1588/TSN, etc.).
- Geometry: for gNBs ùëñ,ùëó
- <img width="650" height="129" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ec49c2-ce77-4c00-8f41-4c7f3ca6bc2c" />

- More bandwidth ‚áí finer ToA resolution: ideal timing resolution ‚âà 1/BW; ~400 MHz can approach sub-meter (needs high SNR and calibration).
- Inter-gNB synchronization is critical: clock error maps directly to range-difference error.
- Multipath/NLOS: mitigate with peak selection, RANSAC/consistency checks, or add AoA aids.
- Geometry/observability: at least 3 gNBs (‚â•2 TDoAs) for robust intersections; poor geometry inflates error (GDOP).
- Uplink references: typically SRS (wideband, repeatable); PRACH is possible but with bandwidth/interpolation constraints.


- Implementation of 3GPP UL-TDoA Positioning in OAI
- RAN: Performs SRS‚ÜíToA estimation in the OAI gNB; implements NRPPa functionality and sends it to the AMF.
- Core: Integrates with the TU-Dresden LMF; communicates NRPPa PDUs between the gNB and AMF, and between the AMF and LMF; implements built-in/pluggable positioning algorithms in the LMF; and connects to the Fraunhofer IIS PaaS.
- API: Externally triggers positioning; accurately aligns antenna and UE positions using Cartesian coordinates.

## 1.1 Background
- Communications and radar have evolved separately but share algorithms, hardware, and partially architectures.Driven by spectrum/cost/energy sharing, there‚Äôs growing interest in coexistence ‚Üí cooperation ‚Üí joint design (JCAS/ISAC).
- Traditional coexistence: Two independent systems transmit **separate signals** (possibly overlapping in time/frequency) and rely on **interference management** (beamforming, cooperative/dynamic sharing, primary‚Äìsecondary access).**Limits**: requires tight mobility constraints and information exchange; spectral-efficiency gains are limited and conditions are stringent.
- Passive sensing: Use arbitrary radio signals (TV, Wi-Fi, cellular) for sensing because the environment imprints on received signals.

  Pros: no dedicated radar waveform needed.
  
  Two major drawbacks:
  - TX/RX not synchronized ‚Üí unknown, time-varying time/frequency/phase offsets ‚áí timing/ranging ambiguity and hard-to-fuse measurements.
  - Unknown signal structure ‚Üí poor interference suppression and multi-user separation; waveforms are not optimized for sensing.

- From ‚Äúradar‚Äù to broader ‚Äúradio sensing‚Äù:
  - Radio sensing = extracting information from received radio signals (not from the carried comms data).
  - Two processing tracks: sensing parameter estimation (delay, AoA/AoD, Doppler, path magnitudes) and pattern recognition (device/object/activity ‚Äúradio signatures‚Äù).
  - Works over existing infrastructures (IoT, Wi-Fi, 5G). Many studies show low-bandwidth comms signals can support sensing (e.g., Wi-Fi, RFID, ZigBee).
 
- JCAS/ISAC core idea: One jointly designed transmit signal serves both communications and sensing.
  - Hardware sharing: most TX modules and much of RX hardware are shared (baseband processing diverges).
  - Advantages over passive sensing: controllable synchronization, known signal structure, multi-user separation/interference suppression, and waveform/scheduling optimized for sensing.
  - Different from:
    - Separated waveforms (time/frequency/code partition),
    - Conventional coexistence (two independent systems avoiding interference),
    - Cognitive radio (secondary users opportunistically access spectrum).
JCAS = one system, one signal, jointly designed for both functions.

| Standards compatibility | Minor extensions                           | Radar-led, loosely tied to comms standards    | May need new specs / larger changes                   |

| Typical strength        | Fast deployment, easy in existing networks | Excellent radar accuracy/range                | Best spectrum/energy efficiency; system-level optimum |
| Typical weakness        | Limited sensing flexibility/accuracy       | Limited data rate                             | Design complexity; ecosystem/standardization effort   |
| Good fit                | Add sensing inside 3GPP/Wi-Fi systems      | Radar-centric domains (automotive/industrial) | Greenfield/6G R\&D, private networks                  |


### 1.2.1 Major Differences Between Communications and Sensing
- Radar/radio-sensing signals are built to estimate physical parameters (range, Doppler, angle) accurately and simply.
- Communication signals are built to carry as much information as reliably as possible across many users and QoS profiles.
- Because the design goals differ, their preferred waveforms/structures conflict, so you can‚Äôt drop one into the other without tweaks.

| Dimension            | Radar / Sensing                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Communications                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary goal**     | High-accuracy localization & tracking; simple parameter estimation                                                                                                                                               | Maximize information rate & reliability across users/QoS                                                                                             |
| **Waveform traits**  | Low **PAPR** ‚Üí efficient PA & long range; **sharp ambiguity function** (narrow/steep mainlobe, low sidelobes) for high range/Doppler resolution; often deterministic (pulses, chirps, constant-envelope options) | Rich **modulation/coding** across time/frequency/space; **packetized**, scheduler-driven; may be **discontinuous/fragmented** over RBs, slots, beams |
| **Resource use**     | Typically contiguous time‚Äìfrequency blocks, long coherent processing intervals                                                                                                                                   | Highly dynamic allocation (OFDMA/TDMA/beam hopping, CA), multiuser multiplexing                                                                      |
| **Receiver focus**   | Matched filtering, range‚ÄìDoppler‚Äìangle estimation, CFAR                                                                                                                                                          | Sync, channel estimation, equalization, decoding, HARQ                                                                                               |
| **Typical waveform** | Pulsed/linear-FM (chirp), CW/FMCW, radar-OFDM with sensing-friendly design                                                                                                                                       | OFDM/OFDMA with high PAPR and data payloads + pilots/DMRS                                                                                            |

- Using comms for sensing suffers from high PAPR, fragmented resources, and an OFDM ambiguity function that isn‚Äôt ideal (range‚ÄìDoppler coupling, sidelobes) ‚Üí needs dedicated pilots/PRS, windowing, guard resources, or PAPR reduction.
- Using radar for comms preserves sensing accuracy, but limits data rate/spectral efficiency unless you relax radar optimality.
- Joint design can tune: pilot density, burst timing, bandwidth, beam scheduling, and waveform shaping to get both good sensing resolution and acceptable throughput/latency.


- Two conventional radar families:
  - Pulsed radar: transmits short, wideband pulses, then stays silent to receive echoes.
  - Continuous-wave radar (e.g., FMCW): transmits continuously (often chirps), sweeping over a wide frequency range.
  
  Both are typically non-modulated and used in SISO or MIMO (with orthogonal waveforms for MIMO).
  
- Design goals for radar waveforms:
  - Low PAPR ‚Üí efficient power amplifiers and long-range operation.
  - Sharp ambiguity function (narrow/steep mainlobe, low sidelobes) ‚Üí high range/Doppler resolution.
  - Simple receiver processing to estimate delay, Doppler, and angle of arrival.
  
- Sampling/processing differences:
  - Pulsed radar: sample roughly at 2√ó the pulse bandwidth, or at a lower rate set by the desired range (delay) resolution.
  - FMCW radar: sample only the beat frequency, at a rate much smaller than the sweep bandwidth, sized to the maximum delay to detect.
 
- What communication signals look like
  - They‚Äôre built to carry lots of data: heavily modulated, packetized, and often include non-modulated training (preambles/pilots) as in Fig. 1.2.
  - To serve many devices and QoS levels, they can be complex: discontinuous/fragmented in time‚Äìfrequency, high PAPR, and use advanced modulations across time, frequency, and space (MIMO/beamforming).
 
- Can they be used for sensing?
  - Yes‚Äîpotentially you can estimate delay, Doppler, angle, path power, etc. from comms signals.
  - But sensing needs more than the usual comms channel estimate.

- ‚ÄúChannel coefficients‚Äù vs ‚Äúchannel composition‚Äù
  - Comms receiver: estimates a compact set of channel coefficients (effective complex gains on pilots/subcarriers) good enough for equalization/decoding.
  - Sensing: needs the composition of the channel‚Äîi.e., the set of multipath components with their individual delays, Dopplers, angles, and amplitudes.
  That‚Äôs a finer, higher-resolution description and is hardware-limited (ADC rate, dynamic range/linearity, clocks/calibration) and algorithmically harder than standard channel estimation.

- Why new sensing algorithms are needed
  - Comms signals‚Äô fragmentation, high PAPR, and rich structures make them unlike classic radar waveforms, so radar processors can‚Äôt be used as-is.
  - To do coherent sensing, you must know the exact signal structure (resource mapping in time/frequency/space and even the data symbols if you want data-aided processing).
Without that knowledge‚Äîas in most passive radar‚Äîyou‚Äôre stuck with non-coherent detection, which yields fewer parameters and worse performance.

- Two real-world blockers for comm-integrated sensing:
  - Full-duplex (FD) with co-located TX/RX‚Äîas in monostatic radar‚Äîremains hard in communications (self-interference is tough).
  - Asynchrony between spatially separated TX/RX nodes‚Äîclocks aren‚Äôt aligned‚Äîhurts the fine time/phase info sensing needs.

- Why classic radar tricks don‚Äôt port cleanly
- Pulsed radar: uses transmit ‚Üí long silence ‚Üí receive (effectively TDD) to dodge FD. Great for sensing, but those long quiet windows conflict with high-throughput/low-latency comms.
- Continuous-wave (FMCW): uses the TX signal as the LO reference at the receiver and only processes the beat frequency (difference between TX and echo). This is low-complexity and efficient for sensing, but:
  - The availability and bandwidth of the beat signal are uncertain, so it‚Äôs unreliable for data carriage.
  - Overall, these designs constrain integration of communication functions and limit achievable data rates.

- Impact on ISAC/JCAS in communications
  - FD for comms is still immature (requires deep self-interference cancellation, high linearity, large ADC dynamic range).
  - Clock asynchrony across nodes degrades time-/phase-based sensing (precise ToA/TDoA, coherent processing).
  - Bottom line: simply dropping monostatic radar FD techniques into current comm systems hits reliability and throughput limits‚Äîyou need new sensing solutions and system designs.

- Waveform: Radar favors low-PAPR, ambiguity-friendly waveforms; communications favors complex, packetized, high-PAPR signals; JCAS can use either and co-design to optimize both functions.
- Tx power & range: Radar is typically high-power (long range); communications is lower-power (up to a few km). JCAS embedded in radar can reach very long links; sensing embedded in comms has shorter per-link range but benefits from network coverage.
- Bandwidth: Radar uses large bandwidth for range resolution; comms is typically smaller. mmWave bandwidth is especially attractive for JCAS, though low-BW sensing (e.g., Wi-Fi) is also possible.
- Bands: Radar often in X/S/C/Ku; comms in sub-6 GHz and mmWave. Available band directly impacts JCAS distance and resolution.
- Duplexing: Radar can be FD (CW) or HD (pulsed). Comms co-located TX/RX rarely operate same-time/same-frequency (mostly TDD/FDD). JCAS: FD is nice to have, not strictly required.
- Clock sync: Radar TX/RX typically share a clock. In comms, only co-located nodes share a clock; distributed nodes don‚Äôt. JCAS: clock-level sync removes ambiguity for sensing, but isn‚Äôt mandatory for all apps.

## 1.2.2 Communications-Centric Design
- CC-JCAS
  - CC-JCAS adds radio sensing to an existing communication system as a secondary function.
  - The main signals/protocols stay largely unchanged; you may need some infrastructure tweaks or feature extensions.

- Two fundamental hurdles
  - Monostatic full-duplex (FD): TX and sensing RX are co-located and must transmit and receive simultaneously on the same band.
  - Clock asynchrony in bi/multi-static setups: spatially separated TX/RX nodes usually don‚Äôt share clocks, so timing/phase errors corrupt sensing estimates.
 
- Why classic radar tricks don‚Äôt port to comms
  - Pulsed radar avoids FD by separating TX/RX in time (TDD), which creates near-field blind zones and clashes with continuous high-throughput comms.
  - FMCW radar uses the TX signal as the LO reference and only processes the beat frequency, which carries little of the transmitted data; modern comms use continuous waveforms with sinusoidal LOs, so this approach isn‚Äôt practical unless you bolt on FMCW-like sensing hardware.

- FD cancellation for communications is a promising long-term solution for monostatic sensing, but not yet mature for broad deployment.
- Clock sync in bi/multi-static radar is often done via cables or GPS disciplining‚Äîworkable in some comm setups, but not a general solution.


- CC-JCAS by network topology
- Two subcategories
  - Point-to-point (P2P) JCAS ‚Äì sensing added to a single comms link (common in vehicular networks).
  - Network JCAS ‚Äì sensing realized in a multi-node network (e.g., cellular/mobile).

- Geometry analogy for sensing
  - Monostatic: TX and sensing RX co-located.
  - Bistatic: TX and sensing RX at different nodes.
  - Multistatic: multiple spatially separated TX/RX nodes.

| Aspect                             | Wi-Fi networks (vs Mobile)                                                   | Implications for **Wi-Fi-JCAS** (vs PMN)                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signal format & transmission**   | Simpler, flexible packets; timing/channel structure less rigid than cellular | More freedom to optimize waveforms; sensing opportunities are **more random in time** (less deterministic scheduling) |
| **Multiuser access**               | Simpler MAC; cellular has complex resource allocation & mixed MU access      | Parameter estimation can be **simpler**; more algorithm choices (but fewer tightly scheduled pilots)                  |
| **Deployment environment**         | Mostly **indoor**, low speed                                                 | Richer **multipath** but **stable clutter** ‚Üí sensing is often **easier** than outdoor cellular                       |
| **Network infrastructure & scale** | Smaller networks; less powerful infra (e.g., smaller arrays)                 | Limited **networked sensing** potential; typically **lower sensing resolution** than large cellular arrays            |


## 1.2.3 Radar-Centric (RC) Design
- What RC-JCAS is
  - Start from a radar (often long-range, military/aviation) and add communications on top of the radar waveform/hardware.
  - Often called Dual-Function Radar‚ÄìCommunications (DFRC); in this book DFRC ‚âà RC-JCAS.

- Very long range links (hundreds of km possible) and lower latency than satellite, since you reuse high-power radar transmitters and narrow, directive beams.

- Main limitation
  - Data rate is constrained by the radar waveform (pulsed or CW/FMCW). You can convey data, but not at cellular-like throughputs unless you change the waveform/receiver.
 
- Core technical challenge: information embedding
  - Embed data into pulsed or continuous-wave radar signals while barely disturbing radar performance.
  - Techniques surveyed in the literature include various information embedding schemes; goal = minimal radar impact + as high a data rate as feasible.


- Index Modulation (IM) for RC-JCAS
  - Carry bits via the indices/combinations of resources in space, time, frequency, code (e.g., which subcarriers or TX antennas are active).
  - Key advantage: IM does not alter the basic radar waveform/structure, so sensing performance is essentially preserved while enabling data transfer.

1.2.4 Joint Design without an Underlying System
- Design JCAS from scratch‚Äînot constrained by legacy comms or radar‚Äîso waveform/beamforming/scheduling can be jointly optimized to trade off comms throughput and sensing accuracy.
- Design freedom: choose waveforms, frames, pilots, beams, and MAC specifically for joint goals.
- Better trade-offs: tune metrics (rate, latency, range/angle/Doppler resolution) explicitly.

- mmWave & sub-THz JCAS
  - Pros: huge bandwidth + short wavelength ‚áí high data rates and fine sensing resolution.
  - Status: standards still emerging; ideal for new designs.

- Multichannel / Frequency-Hopping JCAS
- Use one (or a few) channels at a time, but hop across many over a period (e.g., Bluetooth-like FH).
- Net effect: large aggregate sensing bandwidth without large instantaneous comm bandwidth ‚Üí lower RF/ADC cost and fits spectrum usage.
- Key challenge: stitching channels‚Äîremove per-channel distortions/offsets (gain/phase/timing/LO drift) and concatenate coherently.
- JCAS twist: co-design signals/frames to ease concatenation while not hurting comm rate/latency.

- Design levers
  - Waveform: OFDM/PMCW/SC, guard intervals, PAPR control, pilot density/placement.
  - Beams: multibeam patterns, update cadence, hybrid precoder splitting power/time across tasks.
  - Scheduling: mini-frames or sensing bursts that preserve HARQ/latency budgets.
  - Resources: subcarrier/PRB partition (static, dynamic, interleaved) for comms vs sensing.
  - Calibration & sync: per-beam/ per-channel phase & delay calibration to enable coherent sensing.

# [A Tutorial on 5G Positioning](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ntust.idm.oclc.org/document/10644093)
## II. 5G POSITIONING: HISTORY, PRESENT, AND FUTURE
- Goal of the section: start from use-case requirements, review the evolution of cellular positioning, then zoom in on 5G (Rel-15 ‚Üí Rel-19) features and trends‚Äîbuilding an end-to-end picture from past to future.
- II-A (Use-case requirements): enumerates KPIs/constraints for localization across verticals‚Äîaccuracy, latency, availability/reliability, power, update rate, coverage (indoor/outdoor)‚Äîas design targets.
- II-B (Technological evolution): traces how positioning advanced from early analog/2G through 3G/4G to 5G, highlighting improvements in measurements, synchronization, network assistance, signals, and algorithms.
- II-C (5G specifics): summarizes key enhancements from Rel-15 up to forthcoming Rel-19:
  - New/enhanced measurements & reference signals (e.g., PRS/SRS), beam-based AoA/AoD, and multi-site cooperation;
  - Stronger system/architectural support in RAN and core (positioning functions, protocols);
  - Capability extensions targeting verticals and future directions.

### A. Cellular Positioning Use Cases
- KPI
  - Accuracy: bound on position error;
  - Availability/Coverage: where/how often positioning is offered;
  - Latency: time to deliver a position fix;
  - Update rate: refresh frequency;
  - Energy: device/network power budget;
  - Reliability/Integrity: trustworthiness and fault/Degradation alerts.

- Terminal speed matters: higher speeds make it harder to guarantee the same accuracy/latency/integrity; meeting static-like accuracy under high dynamics is more challenging.


### B. Evolution of Cellular Positioning Technology From
- 4G/LTE (E-UTRA): OFDMA in DL, SC-FDMA in UL; designed PRS for downlink positioning as a backup to A-GPS when satellites are not visible.
- Release-9 (2009) leap: introduced eCID and OTDOA (using PRS), and specified
  - LPP (TS 36.355) for LTE positioning,
  - A-GNSS (TS 36.305).

- Rel-10 (LTE-A):
  - Introduced UL-TDOA based on SRS to complement A-GNSS (useful when GNSS is blocked).
  - PRS improvements to boost hearability‚Äîi.e., the UE‚Äôs ability to receive and distinguish PRS from multiple cells vs. ordinary DL signals.

- Rel-13 (LTE-A Pro) (targeting strict indoor):
  - OTDOA enhancements: new PRS patterns and bandwidth extension.
  - MIMO/beamforming added to improve measurement SNR/directionality.

- Rel-14: continued LTE evolution and set the starting point for 5G.

### C. 5G Positioning From Rel-15 to Rel-19
- Rel-15 (2017‚Äì2018, Phase-1: foundation)
  - Bands: sub-6 GHz + mmWave.
  - Use cases: eMBB, mMTC, URLLC (practical focus on eMBB).
  - System enablers: network slicing, MEC, enhanced V2X.
  - Positioning: no major enhancements vs. LTE; mainly lays NR groundwork.
 
- Rel-16 (end-2018‚Üí, Phase-2: expansion)
  - Focus: URLLC and mMTC; 6 GHz support.
  - Positioning architecture: 5G LCS defined in TS 23.273.
  - Reference signals: DL-PRS and UL-SRS (enhanced PRS/SRS).
    - PRS enables simultaneous TOA reports from multiple gNBs and RTT computation.
    - Lower overhead, higher accuracy.
  - Bands: FR1 (410 MHz‚Äì7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25‚Äì52.6 GHz); wider BW ‚áí better ranging.
  - Outlook: possible FR3 (7‚Äì24 GHz) in future releases.

- Rel-17 5G positioning
- Overview
  - Built on Rel-16: adds 2.5/4.5 GHz, extends FR2 to 71 GHz, increases gNB coverage, and improves MEC, slicing, and V2X.

- Key positioning upgrades
  - Tx/Rx timing-error mitigation via TEGs
    - Signals from the same TRP share similar Tx delay ‚Üí tag them with a Timing Error Group; different TRPs may use different groups.
    - Using TEG IDs, UE mitigates residual Tx/Rx delay, improving ranging.
   
  - UL-AOA / DL-AOD
    - UL-AOA: extra assistance (expected AOA + search window) and multi-angle reporting to pick the LOS among similar-delay MPCs; introduces UL-SRS RSRPP (path-specific power).
    - DL-AOD: adds DL-PRS RSRPP and a search window (path-level metric vs. channel-level RSRP) to reduce multipath bias.
   
  - Multipath mitigation
    - Report up to 8 additional paths along with the main one for timing estimation.
  - LOS/NLOS identification
    - Provide binary or likelihood (0‚Äì1, step 0.1) indicators to aid measurement selection/weighting.
  - Integrity (GNSS-like) in Rel-17
    - AL (max allowable error), TTA (max time to raise an alert), TIR (probability error > AL without alert within TTA).

- Design takeaway: plan for PRS/SRS in Rel-16; exploit TEGs/RSRPP/LOS flags in Rel-17; start evaluating AI-assisted fusion and new signals/methods as you move into Rel-18/19.

- 5G-Advanced (Rel-18) is the bridge toward 6G, infusing pervasive AI/ML across layers.
- Network upgrades span energy savings, coverage, mobility, MIMO, MBMS, and positioning.
- Positioning in Rel-18:
  - CPP (carrier-phase positioning) adapted to NR signals for cm-level outdoor accuracy;
  -LPHAP (low-power, high-accuracy) requirements;
  - RedCap UE positioning;
  - AI/ML for beam management, fingerprinting, and measurement inference/refinement;
  - Sidelink positioning with SL-PRS.
- Rel-19 and beyond: address industrial needs (e.g., metaverse with pose + position, energy-harvesting tags for asset tracking); push decentralized on-device AI/ML with device-to-device data/model sharing; study service/performance needs for direct AI/ML; enhance assisted/direct AI/ML positioning, beam management, and CSI feedback (May 2024 discussions).

### D. Positioning Trends Beyond 5G
- Beyond-5G trends span THz, RIS, CPP, near-field, D-MIMO, NTN, UAV, ISAC, 6D pose, sidelink/coop positioning, AI.

- THz bands:
  - Pros: very wide bandwidth ‚Üí finer delay resolution; antenna miniaturization ‚Üí larger arrays and better angular resolution; enable THz imaging/SLAM, even leveraging NLOS multipath.
  - Cons: high path loss and atmospheric absorption, leading to short range; requires advanced precoding/beam management to maintain links.
- Net effect: huge accuracy gains are feasible, provided coverage and robustness are handled via narrow high-gain beams, dense TRPs/relays, and agile beam tracking.
---
- RIS:
  - RIS (aka RIM) are software-controlled EM surfaces that reshape propagation.
  - For positioning: enable accuracy in NLOS, act as a multipath controller, create virtual anchors and path-level measurements (angles/delays); each element behaves like a local emitter to harden links.
  - Variants: TIS, space‚Äìtime modulated metasurfaces, fully-passive flexible/chipless skins.
  - Deployment: physical constraints ‚áí use conformal metasurfaces on curved objects (e.g., vehicles).
  - Big picture: programmable waves enable holographic localization (HL); with RIS/LIS + NFC, approach capacity limits and boost NLOS positioning.
---
- CPP:

What it is: Uses the absolute carrier phase to infer range; can reach cm/sub-cm accuracy‚Äîfar beyond group-delay TDOA/RTT.

Why it matters: Studies show orders-of-magnitude accuracy gains; works with GNSS-assisted or cellular-only designs across FR1/FR2 and massive MIMO.

Key challenges: Integer ambiguity resolution, phase continuity/cycle slips, oscillator & hardware phase biases, multipath/NLOS.

Practical tips:
- Borrow RTK/PPP ideas (differencing, assistance, continuous observation) for ambiguity fixing.
- Fuse time-based + phase-based (RTT/OTDOA + CPP) to boost availability.
- In FR2, use narrow beams to suppress multipath; in FR1, leverage multi-TRP geometry and path-level metrics (e.g., RSRPP) plus LOS detection.
---
- NTN ‚Äî Non-Terrestrial Networks

What it is: Satellite/HAPS/UAV platforms extending coverage and adding positioning geometry.

Why it matters: Wider geometry and extra links can improve accuracy (CRB analyses); critical for remote/underserved areas.

Key challenges: Strong Doppler & time-varying geometry, clock/orbit errors, long RTT, intermittent visibility, interworking with terrestrial NR.

Practical tips:
- Use precise ephemeris/clock assistance and multi-band/multi-link fusion; track dynamics with model-based filters (EKF/UKF).
- Hybrid terrestrial + NTN positioning improves availability and integrity.
---
- UAV:

What it is: 5G‚Äôs high rate/low latency/coverage enabling accurate UAV navigation and tracking; joint designs (beamforming, short blocklengths) achieve cm-level for mapping/inspection.

Key challenges: Fast 3D motion ‚Üí frequent beam alignment/handover; blockage/regulatory constraints; tight power/weight budgets.

Practical tips:
- Combine multi-TRP PRS/SRS with fast beam prediction (AI/ML).
- Tightly fuse IMU/baro/vision with RF (EKF/factor graphs).
---
- NFC

What it is: With very large arrays/RIS/D-MIMO, propagation becomes near-field: spherical wavefronts, spatial non-stationarity, beam squint.

Why it matters: Properly modeled, near-field gives simultaneous angle + range resolution‚Äîenabling high accuracy even with narrow bandwidth (PCRB results).

Key challenges: Accurate near-field modeling/calibration, high-dimensional estimation, computational load.

Practical tips:
- Use spherical-wave models and range‚Äìangle separable estimators to reduce dimension.
- Exploit subarray/subcarrier joint processing to mitigate beam squint.
- Algorithms: near-field MUSIC/ESPRIT, sparse recovery, factor-graph inference.
---
D-MIMO (Distributed MIMO)

Idea: Antennas are split across phase- or frequency-coherent nodes over an area (cell-free / distributed arrays), not co-located like conventional MIMO.
Why it helps positioning: Wider spatial aperture ‚Üí stronger geometry, diversity, and robustness; more anchors without adding base stations.
- What research shows:

Fiber-assisted D-MIMO for precise localization; JRC (joint radar‚Äìcomms) strategies that co-optimize sensing & comms; extensions even to underwater.

Cell-free massive MIMO surveys highlight scalability, user experience and spectral-efficiency gains; ‚Äúmulti-array‚Äù/DAS (e.g., multiple panels on a vehicle) improves blockage resilience and can enable single-BS TDOA when ‚â•2 separated arrays are available.
Algorithms in play: graph-based fusion, (sequential) MMSE, ZF, etc.
Modes:

Phase-coherent (shared phase) ‚Üí best for fine-grained ranging/angle but harder to implement at high freq.

Frequency-coherent (per-antenna channels, relaxed phase) ‚Üí easier at mmWave; still valuable for positioning.
Where it shines: dense urban venues, stadiums, factories‚Äîhigh user density + frequent blockage.

---
ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communications)

- Idea: One infrastructure does both sensing and comms ‚Üí shared waveforms/hardware, real-time multi-sensor fusion.
- Positioning benefits: Better accuracy (data fusion), redundancy for reliability, adaptability to dynamics; adds new sensing functions (radar-/spectroscopy-like).
- Evidence: ISAC-based SLAM/data association can localize UEs without priors; road-safety case studies show promise.
- Comms side bonus: ISAC can cut beam training/handover overhead via sensing-assisted prediction.

---
- 6D Positioning (3D position + 3D orientation/pose)

- Why now: B5G apps (C-ITS, assisted living, UAV SAR, VR/AR, robots, digital twins) need pose, not just position.
- Limits of GNSS+IMU: Indoors GNSS fails; IMU drifts.
- Cellular approach: Use multiple BSs/arrays (possibly D-MIMO/mmWave) to estimate both position and heading/orientation natively.

---
Sidelink (SL) & Cooperative Positioning (CP)

- Sidelink: Direct D2D (e.g., V2V) ‚Üí low latency, works out-of-coverage, supports accurate relative positioning; can leverage maps/CSI priors.
- Standard direction: Unify UL/DL/SL so comms+localization+sensing converge in 6G.
- Cooperative positioning: Centralized or distributed fusion across agents‚Äîkey for IoT, C-ITS, maritime, cobots, UAV swarms. RIS can serve as known-pose anchor nodes.

---
- AI for Positioning

Two classes:

- AI/ML-assisted (enhancing geometry-based pipelines): measurement estimation/correction (e.g., NLOS mitigation), better Bayesian tracking, CSI prediction/compression.

- Direct AI/ML (fingerprinting): learn mapping from channel features (CIR/CSI) to position; focus on generalization & feature design.
- Toolkit: classic ML (SVM/RVM for NLOS ID), DNN/CNN/Autoencoders on full CIR (indoor/outdoor), GNNs, Federated Learning (privacy-preserving map matching), BNNs for uncertainty (and BNN-augmented tracking under NLOS).
Near-term 3GPP uses: RB allocation, mobility, channel estimation, scheduling, beam management; Rel-18 seeds, broader 6G adoption.

## IV. 5G POSITIONING TECHNOLOGY
### A. 5G Positioning Architectures
- The 5G system used for positioning consists of the 5G core network (5GCN) and the radio access network (RAN). The 5GCN follows a service-based architecture (SBA): network functions (NFs) expose services to each other and interact through the service-based interface (SBI). Two key NFs for positioning are the Location Management Function (LMF) and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).
- The LMF orchestrates all UE-localization procedures: it selects the positioning method, schedules resources, coordinates involved nodes, and prepares assistance data to be broadcast to UEs. The AMF provides location services support (e.g., emergency calls) and can initiate a localization request for a UE. In practice, the AMF often acts as an intermediary between the LMF and either the RAN or the UE.
- The RAN participates directly in positioning procedures. It transfers messages between the UE and the AMF/LMF‚Äîsuch as positioning signaling and broadcast assistance data‚Äîand executes radio actions required by the chosen method. The next-generation RAN (NG-RAN) comprises an en-gNB for LTE access and a gNB for NR access. Unlike the monolithic 4G eNB, a 5G base station can be split into a gNB Central Unit (gNB-CU) and one or more gNB Distributed Units (gNB-DUs).
A gNB can transmit in downlink (DL) or measure in uplink (UL), enabling both DL- and UL-based positioning schemes. This dual role is enabled by the Transmission Reception Point (TRP) concept: a TRP may operate as a Transmission Point (TP), a Reception Point (RP), or both, giving the network flexibility to realize different positioning methods.

### D. 5G Positioning Signals
- Motivation (Rel-16). Earlier reference signals not designed for positioning‚ÄîCSI-RS and SS blocks (SSB/SS)‚Äîhave limits: (i) they can‚Äôt fully solve the hearability problem (UE must detect signals from several cells at once while neighboring cells interfere); (ii) strong nearby cells shadow weak far-away signals; (iii) the RE density/pattern of CSI-RS and SSB gives poor correlation and may not spread energy over all subcarriers.
Therefore, Rel-16 introduces dedicated positioning signals: PRS for downlink and SRS for uplink, enabling precise positioning in 5G networks.
#### SSB:
- <img width="813" height="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdbfd8c6-6b40-4f08-a270-394b1408c2e9" />
- CSI-RS (Channel-State Information RS)
  -  Originally meant for CSI acquisition (beam management, CQI/PMI/RI reporting). It is not tailored to positioning, and‚Äîin dense networks‚Äîits correlation and frequency coverage are often insufficient for robust multi-cell ranging.
 
- PRS (Positioning Reference Signal, DL)
  - Rel-16 adds PRS so the network can transmit positioning-friendly pilots: wideband, configurable time‚Äìfrequency patterns with higher RE density/repetition and beam options. UEs measure PRS (e.g., TOA/TDOA, possibly AOD) from multiple TRPs with low interference and good cross-correlation, improving hearability.

- SRS (Sounding Reference Signal, UL)
  - Rel-16 leverages SRS for uplink positioning. The UE transmits SRS across configurable bandwidth/beam sets; multiple TRPs receive it to derive AOA, TOA/TDOA, or full-band channel features. The number of UL beams relates to the RE budget per slot.
 
#### CSI-RS:
- CSI reference signals (CSI-RS) were introduced in Rel-10 to acquire channel state information (beam management, CSI feedback). They are not primarily designed for positioning, but can be reused when configured properly.
- Key properties
  - Spatial layers: To support up to 8-layer spatial multiplexing, a TRP can configure the same number of CSI-RS signals/ports.
  - Time domain: Periodic; you can schedule 2‚Äì8 CSI-RS per 10-ms frame (i.e., one every 5‚Äì1.25 ms). A subframe offset is also configurable.
  - Frequency domain: CSI-RS can be transmitted in every RB, so it can cover the entire channel bandwidth. The exact RE pattern/density depends on the chosen CSI-RS configuration (ports, comb, density).

## configure_dedicated_BWP_ul()
- config_ue.c is OAI‚Äôs UE-side RRC‚ÜíMAC/PHY configuration bridge. It parses the gNB‚Äôs RRC messages (MIB, SIB1/SIB19, CellGroupConfig, etc.) and translates their ASN.1 IEs into OAI UE internal state and PHY/FAPI config. It sets up carrier/BWP/CORESET & search spaces, PDSCH/PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS, CSI-RS & CSI reporting, timers (BSR/SR/TA), TDD pattern, PRACH, builds the valid SSB list, applies reconfiguration-with-sync, handles NTN timing advance (Rel-17), and cleans up on reset.
- **Guard & fetch BWP slot**
  - If ul_dedicated is non-NULL, it calls get_ul_bwp_structure(mac, bwp_id, true) to get (or create) the internal NR_UE_UL_BWP_t for bwp_id.
  - Sets bwp->bwp_id = bwp_id.
- **UCCH configuration (uplink control channel)**
  - Checks ul_dedicated->pucch_Config.
  - Release case: if present == ...PR_release, frees the existing bwp->pucch_Config via asn1cFreeStruc(asn_DEF_NR_PUCCH_Config, ...).
  - Setup case: if present == ...PR_setup, ensures bwp->pucch_Config exists (allocates with calloc if needed), then calls
    setup_pucchconfig(ul_dedicated->pucch_Config->choice.setup, bwp->pucch_Config)
    to translate the ASN.1 RRC IE into the UE‚Äôs internal structure.
- **PUSCH configuration (uplink shared channel)**
  - Same pattern:
    - Release: asn1cFreeStruc(asn_DEF_NR_PUSCH_Config, bwp->pusch_Config).
    - Setup: allocate if NULL, then
      setup_puschconfig(mac, ul_dedicated->pusch_Config->choice.setup, bwp->pusch_Config).

- **SRS configuration (sounding reference signal)**
  - Same pattern:
    - Release: asn1cFreeStruc(asn_DEF_NR_SRS_Config, bwp->srs_Config).
    - Setup: allocate if NULL, then
      setup_srsconfig(bwp, ul_dedicated->srs_Config->choice.setup, bwp->srs_Config).

- Typically invoked when the UE processes an RRC(Re)configuration that modifies uplink BWP-dedicated settings. After this call, the UE MAC (and then PHY) will use the updated per-BWP configs for uplink scheduling, control reporting (PUCCH), data (PUSCH), and channel sounding (SRS).

## setup_srsconfig()
- setup_srsconfig(...) merges the source RRC SRS-Config (source) into the UE's current BWP SRS-Config (target). It follows the RRC AddMod/Release rules: if there is an Add/Mod, the corresponding SRS-Resource / SRS-ResourceSet is added or updated; if there is a Release, the corresponding target item is released based on the id; simple fields (such as tpc_Accumulation) are also updated.
- ket steps:
  - UPDATE_IE: If the source provides tpc_Accumulation, copy it to the target.
  - SRS-Resource:
    - AddModList ‚Üí Ensure the target list exists, then add/update it using srs_ResourceId as the key.
    - ReleaseList ‚Üí Remove from the target list based on srs_ResourceId.
  - SRS-ResourceSet:
    - AddModList ‚Üí Compare srs_ResourceSetIds one by one. If they don't exist, calloc + append a new set (ASN_SEQUENCE_ADD); then use setup_srsresourceset(...) to write the source set's fields to the target set.
    - ReleaseList ‚Üí Remove from the target list based on srs_ResourceSetId.
  - bwp passes setup_srsresourceset(...) to facilitate the helper's calculation/validation of derived fields based on the BWP state.
 
## setup_srsresourceset()
- What setup_srsresourceset(...) does (purpose & flow)
- This routine merges one SRS-ResourceSet IE (source) into the UE‚Äôs current UL-BWP SRS-ResourceSet (target) and updates any derived power-control cache in the BWP when key fields change. It handles the resourceType CHOICE (aperiodic/periodic/semi-persistent), membership lists, usage, and SRS power-control knobs (alpha, p0, pathlossReferenceRS, adjustment states).

# TS 138 214  6.2 UE reference signal (RS) procedure 
## 6.2.1 UE sounding procedure 
- SRS configuration scope
  - UE can be configured with one or more SRS-ResourceSets (and, separately, SRS-PosResourceSets for positioning).
  - In each SRS-ResourceSet, the UE may have K ‚â• 1 SRS-Resources:
    - K (normal SRS) is bounded by UE capability (see UE-cap in 38.306).
    - K (PosSRS): max K = 16.
  - Whether a resource/set applies depends on the usage field of the SRS-ResourceSet.
- Simultaneous transmission rule
  - If usage = beamManagement: at any instant, only one SRS resource per set may be transmitted.
  - However, resources from different sets with the same time-domain behavior (periodicity/offset etc.) within the same BWP may be transmitted simultaneously.
- TCI linkage (beam state the UE should use)
  - If the UE is configured with DLorJoint-TCIState or UL-TCIState, then (with two exceptions noted below) SRS resources in any set can be associated with those TCI states or updated per the referenced clause.
  - Reference RS for TCI:
    - DLorJoint-TCIState: reference can be a CSI-RS in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with repetition or with trs-Info (TRS).
    - UL-TCIState: reference can be a CSI-RS (as above), an SRS resource with usage=beamManagement, or an SS/PBCH block (SSB), possibly with a different PCI than the serving cell.
  - Exceptions: the generic assumption above does not apply to
    - positioning SRS resources, and
    - SRS resource sets configured with followUnifiedTCIState-r17 (those follow the unified TCI behavior explicitly).
- Follow-Unified-TCI (r17) for SRS-ResourceSet
   - If an SRS-ResourceSet (not for positioning) is configured with followUnifiedTCIstate-r17, the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource(s) using the spatial relation (beam / spatial filter) of the reference RS tied to the indicated TCI state:
     - The reference RS is either:
     - For DLorJoint-TCIState: a CSI-RS in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet with repetition or with trs-Info (TRS).
     - For UL-TCIState: a CSI-RS as above, or an SRS with usage=beamManagement, or an SS/PBCH block (SSB) ‚Äî possibly with PCI ‚â† serving cell PCI.
  - Effect: the SRS beamforming follows the downlink (or unified) TCI reference, ensuring DL/UL spatial consistency.
- Aperiodic SRS selection (by DCI)
  - For aperiodic SRS, at least one DCI state selects at least one of the configured SRS-ResourceSet(s).
  - Practical: the gNB uses a DCI field (trigger state) to point to which set (and therefore which resources) the UE should transmit in a given slot.

### Semi-static (higher-layer) SRS parameters
- These are the RRC-configured knobs that define how an SRS looks and when/where it is sent. They change rarely (until a new RRC reconfiguration) and drive both scheduler choices and PHY mapping
- These parameters define when (slot/symbol), where (RBs/subcarriers), how wide (bandwidth/hopping), with which beam/ports (spatial relation, ports), and with what orthogonality (comb/shift/sequence) the UE transmits SRS.
- The scheduler uses them to pick resources/sets (and offsets for aperiodic), while PHY uses them to generate the exact SRS waveform and set the TX spatial filter.

---
- Resource mapping (how many symbols, where in the slot)

| Config                       | Allowed Ns (adjacent symbols) | Placement               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Baseline (`resourceMapping`) | 1, 2, 4                       | **last 6** symbols only |
| r16 (`SRS-Resource`)         | 1, 2, 4                       | **anywhere**            |
| r16 (`SRS-PosResource`)      | 1, 2, 4, 8, 12                | **anywhere**            |
| r17 (`SRS-Resource`)         | 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14        | **anywhere**            |

- Overlap with PUSCH/PUCCH (priority rules)
  - PUSCH (priority index 0) + SRS (same slot, serving cell): UE may only send SRS after finishing PUSCH and its DM-RS in that slot.
  - PUSCH (priority 1) or PUCCH (priority 1) overlapping with SRS: UE does not transmit SRS in the overlapping symbol(s).       

- Periodic SRS ‚Äî spatial relation (beam to use)
  - When resourceType = periodic and spatialRelationInfo (or ‚Ä¶PDC, ‚Ä¶Pos) is configured, the UE transmits SRS with the same spatial-domain TX filter as the reference RS indicated:
  - Reference = SSB (ssb-Index / ‚Ä¶Serving / ‚Ä¶Ncell): use SSB-based spatial filter.
  - Reference = CSI-RS (csi-RS-Index / ‚Ä¶Serving): use the filter used to receive that periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS.
  - Reference = SRS (srs / srs-spatialRelation): use the filter used to transmit the reference periodic SRS.
  - Positioning SRS (SRS-PosResource + dl-PRS): use the filter used to receive the DL-PRS.
  - spatialRelationInfo-PDC with dl-PRS-PDC: use the filter used for DL-PRS reception for RTT-based delay compensation (per spec Clause 9).
The transmit beam of the periodic SRS is not determined autonomously, but follows the indicated reference RS/SSB/PRS to ensure DL/UL spatial consistency or the consistency required by the positioning algorithm.

- UE has one or more SRS resources and the higher-layer resourceType is semi-persistent (either SRS-Resource or SRS-PosResource).
- When the activation actually takes effect
  - The gNB sends a MAC activation command (38.321 ¬ß6.1.3.17 / ¬ß6.1.3.36) on a PDSCH.
  - Suppose the HARQ-ACK for that PDSCH is sent by the UE on PUCCH in slot n.Then the SRS start assumptions (and the MAC actions) become valid from the first slot strictly after:

<img width="661" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e60b804d-500e-4e32-b0db-6a5e3b5f01d6" />

- The activation command also tells you which beam to use
- It includes a list of reference-signal IDs, one per element of the activated SRS-ResourceSet.
- Each ID defines the spatial relation (i.e., which RX/TX spatial filter/beam to copy) for the corresponding SRS.
  - If the set is SRS-ResourceSet (non-positioning):
    - Each ID may refer to one of:
      - an SS/PBCH block (SSB),
      - an NZP-CSI-RS on the serving cell indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID in the command (or the set‚Äôs cell if absent),
      - an SRS resource on the serving cell and UL BWP indicated by Resource Serving Cell ID and Resource BWP ID (or the set‚Äôs cell/BWP if absent).
  - If the set is SRS-PosResourceSet (positioning):
    - Each ID may refer to one of:
      - an SSB on a serving or non-serving cell (given by the PCI field),
      - an NZP-CSI-RS on the serving cell (as above),
      - an SRS resource on the serving cell + UL BWP (as above),
      - a DL-PRS on a serving or non-serving cell (by DL-PRS ID).
     
- In practice: when you activate a semi-persistent SRS set, the command binds each SRS in the set to a specific reference RS/SSB/PRS, and the UE must transmit that SRS using the same spatial-domain filter/beam as that reference.

- Override rule (activation wins)
  - If a resource in the activated set already had an RRC-configured spatialRelationInfo/‚Ä¶Pos, the reference ID(s) carried in the activation command override those.
  ‚Üí During the active period, use the activation‚Äôs reference to choose the SRS TX beam, not the one from RRC.
- Deactivation timing
  - When the UE gets a deactivation command and would send the HARQ-ACK for its PDSCH on PUCCH in slot n, the stop takes effect from the first slot after:
  - <img width="571" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7330b3c9-0b76-4a18-8589-8d0e35c39d34" />
- How to choose the SRS transmit beam (spatial relation)
  - If spatialRelationInfo/‚Ä¶Pos identifies one of the following, transmit the target SRS with the same spatial-domain filter used for that reference:
  - ssb-Index / ‚Ä¶Serving / ‚Ä¶Ncell (SSB): use the SSB receive beam.
  - csi-RS-Index / ‚Ä¶IndexServing (NZP-CSI-RS): use the receive filter for that periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS.
  - srs / srs-SpatialRelation (SRS): use the transmit filter used for that periodic/semi-persistent SRS.
  - dl-PRS (only for SRS-PosResourceSet): use the DL-PRS receive filter.
