＃Foundation Understanding RF simulator 
RFSIM is a simulator designed to replace a physical RF board, allowing OAI to perform communication tests without requiring wireless hardware. It can simulate simple channels such as AWGN. RFSIM is not bound by real-time hardware sampling rates—its execution speed depends on CPU performance and can be faster or slower than real time.
